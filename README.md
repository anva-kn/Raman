# Raman
## Description
This repository primarily serves the purpose of analyzing Raman, SERS, and HPLC spectra acquired from both colleagues 
and experimental endeavors.

## Outline of the repo

 - data directory contains data from all of the experiments, but because the size is too big we don't post it on GitHub
 - Publication directory is where I store all the notebooks for the publication that we are working towards.
 - SyntheticSignal directory contains code for generating "fake" data to quickly test data processing algorithms or to 
expand your dataset
 - tools contains another directory called ramanflow where we have a bunch of logic for reading the data from different 
formats and to process it using different techniques. 
 - the rest of the code needs a lot of reorganization TT
